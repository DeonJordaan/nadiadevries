						<h3>Where we begin</h3>
						<div class="text-block">
							<p>
								The world health organisation describes <strong><span class="content__healthy">health</span></strong> as <br />
								<div class="quote">
									"a state of complete physical, mental and social
									well-being and not merely the absence of disease or
									infirmity"
								</div>
							</p>
						<p>
							Health is integral to overall well-being on a physical, emotional, mental and spiritual level.
							By choosing to live a life that honours your physical,
							mental and social well-being, you will promote the human
							organism's potential for healing itself, thus taking
							control over your own health and wellbeing.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can take control over your own health and wellbeing. By paying attention to your body, you can take note of
							unhealthy habits before they accumulate and cause
							long-term damage.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is where I can be your guide, by acting as an agent
							of long-term behavioural change.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can nourish your health. But nourishment does not
							always mean nutrition.

								<p>
									We will work with 3 core concepts: bio-individuality, primary food and secondary food.</p>
								<p>
									We'll work through these core concepts together and, using self-inquiry and reflection, meet you where you are at in each of them. We can focus on elements that can impact markers of health such as stress, weight and energy levels, to name a few.</p>
								<p>
									By making yourself accountable, I will guide you on your journey to a balanced way of life.</p>
								<p>
									It will be your responsibility and willingness to commit that will be the key to unlocking sustainable health through long-term behaviour change.

						<h3>About Me</h3>
							<div class="text-block">
								<p>
									I am an integrative nutrition health coach, accountant and a yoga teacher.
								</p>
								<p>
									Before shifting into coaching, I completed an Honours Bachelor of Accounting Science and worked as an accountant for 9 years. I also worked as a financial manager in the digital industry for 6 years.
								</p>
								<p>
									My school career was not a normal one, having attended 8 different schools. We moved frequently, never staying in the same place for more than 3 years. It is fair to say that I have a lot of experience in the human's ability to adapt to change. This background equipped me with skills to seamlessly adjust to most environments, practice various communication and connection styles and truly understand the value of positive self regard.
								</p>
								<p>
									My working background in accounting gave me the opportunity to understand the inner workings of various businesses. I was attracted by ever evolving experiences, working with different clients and helping small business owners.
								</p>
								<p>
									What impacted me most was the frantic pace that often left me feeling that no matter what I did, I could never quite get ahead. This feeling of defeat lead to health markers, such as stress, burnout, anxiety, emotional eating and a constant lack of energy. It took all my energy to arrive every day and not be overwhelmed by the mountain that lay ahead of me… every day.
								</p>
								<p>
									What kept me coming back?
								</p>
								<p>
									It was the connection to other human beings. People reaching out, wanting to share their stories and looking for support or inspiration. Or just someone to listen to their story.
									It became clear that I needed to shift my focus from balancing books to balancing my health as the penny dropped and I understood that the ultimate wealth is health.

						<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
							<div class="text-block">
								<h4>What is a health coach?</h4>
									<p>
										Health and wellness coaches work with individuals and groups in a client-centered process to facilitate and empower the client to develop and achieve self-determined goals related to health and wellness. Coaches support clients in mobilising internal strengths and external resources, and in developing self-management strategies for making sustainable, healthy lifestyle, behaviour changes.
										(from NBHWC)
									</p>
								<h4>Can a health coach diagnose or prescribe treatments?</h4>
									<p>
										A health coach does not diagnose conditions, prescribe treatments, or provide psychological therapeutic interventions.</p>
								<h4>Is there a difference between a nutritionist, a dietitian and a health coach?</h4>
									<p>
										Yes, a health coach is not a registered dietitian or a nutritionist. 
										Fundamentally, a health coach can assist with helping you to observe your body's needs. A health coach do not create a meal plan or a diet for you.
									</p>
								<h4>Why is the program 6 months long?</h4>
									<p>
										Long term behaviour change takes time and cannot be rushed.
										I will be your guide on the side that can assist you with making connections between issues and obstacles, if you have the willingness to change.
									</p>
								<h4>What can I expect from the initial consultation?</h4>
									<p>
										It is a free of charge 50 minute consultation. We will discuss your expectations and decide if we are well-suited to work together.
									</p>
								<h4>How does payment work?</h4>
									<p>
										Payment will be made per session and will be due immediately after each session.
									</p>
								<h4>What are your qualifications?</h4>
									<p>
										I graduated with an Honours Bachelor of Accounting Science from the University of South Africa.<br/>
										I also earned a 12 month certificate of Integrative Nutrition Health Coach from the faculty of the Institute for Integrative Nutrition.<br/>
										I am currently busy with a certificate of Coaching Intensive Practicum 2.0 from the faculty of the Institute for Integrative Nutrition.<br/>
										I completed a 300 hour Jivamukti Yoga Teacher Training in Costa Rica.
